# Data Science Project

## Overview
This project is focused on analyzing anxiety levels and related symptoms using various datasets. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, preprocess the data, and prepare it for modeling using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- **data/raw**: Contains the raw data files used in the project.
- **data/processed**: Contains the processed data files after cleaning and transformation.
- **notebooks/DataLab2.1.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook for main analysis and data processing steps.
- **src**: Contains source code for the project.
  - **src/__init__.py**: Indicates that the `src` directory is a Python package.
  - **src/utils.py**: Contains utility functions for data partitioning, cleaning, and other helper functions.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python packages required for the project.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter notebook located in `notebooks/DataLab2.1.ipynb` to start the analysis.
